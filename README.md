# Question: getSmallestintegerPosition

Test Data Generation Write the test data for the function: int
getSmallestIntegerPosition(int[] A) This method accepts as input integer array that is
already sorted and rotated "n" number of items where n is less than the size of the array
For Example: The test data can be {4,5,6,1} This was derived from {1, 4, 5,6} after
sorting and rotating the array for 3 times And output of the function returns the index of
integer that has the smallest value Eg: {4,5,6,1}: the smallest value is 1 and its index is
3 Note: This method searches for the element and derives the position with an order of
O(log(n))

# Question :  Merge Two dimensional array

Merge two-dimensional Array Consider array1 ={{10, 15}, {30, 50}} array2 ={{20,40},
{5, 10}} Merged array should be sandwiched (array 1 should be sandwiched with array
2) also while merging array if value range is less than the previously added value then
that value should not be added to the merged array Output should be {10, 20, 30, 40,
50} --> 15, 5 and 10 should not be added
